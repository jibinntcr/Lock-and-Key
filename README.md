# PasswordManager Class Explanation

The `PasswordManager` class provides functionality for password operations:

## Password Validation

The `validatePasswordStrength` method checks the strength of a password based on these criteria:
- Minimum length of 8 characters
- At least one lowercase letter (a-z)
- At least one uppercase letter (A-Z)
- At least one digit (0-9)
- At least one special character (!@#$%^&*()_+[]{})

It returns "Strong" if all criteria are met, "Intermediate" with fewer requirements, or "Low" for weaker passwords.

## Password Generation

The `generatePassword` method creates passwords of varying complexity based on the `level` parameter:
- "strong": Contains lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Length is 12 characters.
- "intermediate": Contains lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and numbers. Length is 10 characters.
- "low": Contains only lowercase letters. Length is 6 characters.

## Regular Expressions

Regular expressions (`_lowerCase`, `_upperCase`, `_number`, `_specialChar`) are used to check for specific character types in passwords.

## Main Function

In the `main` function, a sample password is validated for strength using `validatePasswordStrength`, and a strong password is generated using `generatePassword`. The results are printed to the console for demonstration.

Overall, the `PasswordManager` class is a handy tool for evaluating and generating secure passwords in Dart.
